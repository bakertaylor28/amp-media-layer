# amp-media-player
This is the public repository for the AMP media player- a DivX 32-bit Windows application (Windows 2000 and later)
which supports Video media files with the .avi, .mpg, .mpeg, .asf and .wmv formats. It requires the necessary codecs to have 
already been installed on your machine. This program is compatible with linux under the WINE emulator.
